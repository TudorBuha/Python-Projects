
The game will begin by each player placing their ships on their own battlefields.
Then, each player will take turns targetting the opposing player's battlefield.
If the player succesfully hits a ship, that player will also have the next turn.
If not, the other player will have the next turn.

The game is won simply by sinking the entire fleet of the opposing player.
